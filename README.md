# Exploratory Data Analysis of Health Insurance Dataset

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a health insurance dataset to understand the relationships between various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Age**: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- **Sex**: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, an objective measure of body weight relative to height (kg/mÂ²). Ideal range: 18.5 - 24.9.
- **Children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents.
- **Smoker**: Indicates whether the individual is a smoker.
- **Region**: Residential area of the beneficiary in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **Charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Key Findings
- **Smoking Trends**: Most smokers are male and predominantly located in the southeast region.
- **Non-smoker Demographics**: Non-smokers are mostly female and primarily aged between 20 and 30 years, with a relatively healthy BMI.
- **BMI Insights**: There is a correlation between age and BMI, where older individuals tend to have higher BMI values, indicating less healthy weight statuses.
- **Age Range**: The age of beneficiaries ranges from 18 to 64 years, with no significant outliers.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the demographics of health insurance beneficiaries and highlights important trends related to smoking, BMI, and medical charges. Further analysis could delve deeper into the causal relationships and potential implications for health insurance policies.
